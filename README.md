<h1>Design_Patterns_Java</h1>
<p>
This repository contains educational implementations of key object-oriented design patterns in Java.
Each pattern is organized into its own package and includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Singleton Pattern</strong>: Demonstrates both thread-safe and unsafe variants;</li>
  <li><strong>Builder Pattern</strong>: Explores burger-building scenarios with abstraction and directors;</li>
  <li><strong>Abstract Factory Pattern</strong>: Uses client contracts to generate cars with shared interfaces;</li>
  <li><strong>Factory Method Pattern</strong>: Provides a car production model where each subclass defines its own product creation logic;</li>
  <li><strong>Facade Pattern</strong>: Simplifies subsystem interactions with an apartment registration example;</li>
  <li><strong>Observer Pattern</strong>: Implements event subscription using TV, Newspaper, and Journalist classes;</li>
  <li><strong>Template Method Pattern</strong>: Defines worker daily routines with concrete subclasses overriding specific behaviors;</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency Injection</strong>: Demonstrates Spring-based DI with services and notification senders;</li>
  <li><strong>Adapter Pattern</strong>: Adapts DropBox API to a common file handler interface for unified file operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The repository is structured for both learning and practical reference. 
JavaDocs and inline comments have been added for all files to improve clarity and support self-study.

<h2>ðŸ“‚ Structure</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>singleton</code>: Lazy initialization, thread-safe variations, and property-based Singleton examples;</li>
  <li><code>builder</code>: Abstract builders, concrete implementations, and a manager class as a director;</li>
  <li><code>abstractfactory</code>: Factory hierarchies for cars and clients with/without contracts;</li>
  <li><code>factorymethod</code>: Abstract creators define car factories, and concrete factories build specific models like Corolla, Jetta, and Model S;</li>
  <li><code>facade</code>: Apartment registration example with simplified interface to complex subsystems;</li>
  <li><code>observer</code>: Implements observer pattern with subjects and observers like TV, Newspaper, and Journalist;</li>
  <li><code>templatemethod</code>: Abstract worker routines with concrete worker types like Cop, Firefighter, and Manager;</li>
  <li><code>dependencyinjection</code>: Spring framework based DI examples with services and notification senders;</li>
  <li><code>adapter</code>: Adapter pattern example integrating DropBox with a generic file handler interface.</li>
</ul>
