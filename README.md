<h1>Design_Patterns_Java</h1>
<p>
This repository contains educational implementations of key object-oriented design patterns in Java.
Each pattern is organized into its own package and includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Singleton Pattern</strong>: Demonstrates both thread-safe and unsafe variants;</li>
  <li><strong>Builder Pattern</strong>: Explores burger-building scenarios with abstraction and directors;</li>
  <li><strong>Abstract Factory Pattern</strong>: Uses client contracts to generate cars with shared interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The repository is structured for both learning and practical reference. 
JavaDocs and inline comments have been added for all files to improve clarity and support self-study.
</p>
<h2>ðŸ“‚ Structure</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>singleton</code>: Lazy initialization, thread-safe variations, and property-based Singleton examples;</li>
  <li><code>builder</code>: Abstract builders, concrete implementations, and a manager class as a director;</li>
  <li><code>abstractfactory</code>: Factory hierarchies for cars and clients with/without contracts.</li>
</ul>
