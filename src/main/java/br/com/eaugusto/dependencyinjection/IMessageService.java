/**
 * This interface defines a contract for message sending services.
 * 
 * It allows multiple implementations like EmailService and SMSService.
 * Classes that depend on IMessageService donâ€™t need to know which implementation is used,
 * they just use the interface.
 * 
 * This is a key benefit of Dependency Injection: decoupling implementation from usage.
